# Mars Rover Simulation

## Overview

The Mars Rover Simulation is a console-based TypeScript application developed for the 2025-26 coding exercises. It simulates a rover navigating a 2D grid on Mars, executing commands while avoiding obstacles. The project exceeds requirements by incorporating three design patterns (Command, Composite, Factory), advanced features like command history and batch execution, and gold standards such as Winston logging and robust error handling. Built with TypeScript in strict mode, it adheres to SOLID principles and global coding conventions, ensuring maintainability, scalability, and an engaging user experience with a space-themed "Mission Control" interface.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- Initialize a rectangular grid with user-defined dimensions and obstacles.
- Set the rover's starting position and direction (N, S, E, W).
- Execute commands:
  - M: Move forward one step.
  - L: Turn left 90 degrees.
  - R: Turn right 90 degrees.
  - S: Display status (position, direction, last 5 commands).
- Prevent movement to obstacle-occupied coordinates.

### Advanced Enhancements
- Command History: Tracks the last 5 commands for auditing in status reports.
- Batch Execution: Supports direct command sequences (e.g., MMRMLM) or explicit batch mode (B).
- Space-Themed Interface: "Mission Control" branding enhances user engagement.

### Design Patterns
- Command Pattern: Encapsulates actions as objects (MoveCommand, TurnLeftCommand, etc.) for extensibility.
- Composite Pattern: Models terrain as a grid with obstacles, using a Set for O(1) lookup.
- Factory Pattern: CommandFactoryImpl dynamically creates commands, reducing coupling.

### Gold Standards
- Logging: Winston logs to console and mars-rover.log for debugging.
- Exception Handling: Try-catch for commands, with a 3-attempt retry mechanism for inputs.
- Input Validation: Validates grid sizes, coordinates, directions, and commands using regex and bounds checks.
- Performance: O(1) obstacle detection with Set, efficient command history with fixed-size array.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js: Install Node.js (v20.x recommended).
- Git: Ensure Git is installed for cloning the repository.

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the Repository:
   git clone https://github.com/harshraj003/mars-rover.git
   cd mars-rover

2. Install Dependencies:
   npm install

3. Run the Application:
   npm start

4. Build and Compile (Optional):
   npm run build

5. View Logs:
   Logs are written to mars-rover.log and displayed in the console.

  - main/:
    - Commands.ts: Command classes and factory.

## Usage

### Running the Program
1. Run npm start and follow prompts:
   - Enter terrain dimensions (e.g., 10 for width, 10 for height).
   - Specify obstacles (e.g., (2,2), (3,5)).
   - Set rover starting position and direction (e.g., (0,0,N)).

2. Execute Commands:
   - Single Commands: M (move), L (left), R (right), S (status), Q (quit).
   - Batch Commands: Enter a sequence like MMRMLM directly or use B for batch mode.
   - Invalid inputs trigger retries (3 attempts) with clear error messages.

### Example Interaction
=== Mars Rover Mission Control ===
Initializing Mars Rover Mission...
Enter terrain width (positive integer): 10
Enter terrain height (positive integer): 10
Enter number of obstacles (non-negative): 2
Enter obstacle 1 x-coordinate (0-9): 2
Enter obstacle 1 y-coordinate (0-9): 2
Enter obstacle 2 x-coordinate (0-9): 3
Enter obstacle 2 y-coordinate (0-9): 5
Enter rover starting x-coordinate (0-9): 0
Enter rover starting y-coordinate (0-9): 0
Enter rover direction (N, S, E, W): N
Commands: M (move), L (left), R (right), S (status), B (batch), Q (quit)
Batch example: MMRMLM (executes multiple commands)

Enter command or batch: MMRMLM

## Design Decisions

### TypeScript with Strict Mode
- Ensures type safety and reduces runtime errors.
- Strict mode (noImplicitAny, strictNullChecks) enhances reliability.

### Command Pattern
- Encapsulates actions (MoveCommand, etc.) as objects.
- Enables extensibility (e.g., adding undo commands) without modifying existing code.

### Composite Pattern
- Models terrain as a grid with obstacles stored in a Set.
- Provides O(1) lookup for obstacle detection, scalable for larger grids.

### Factory Pattern
- CommandFactoryImpl creates commands dynamically.
- Reduces coupling between command creation and execution.

### SOLID Principles
- Single Responsibility: Rover manages state, Terrain handles grid, Commands execute actions.
- Open/Closed: Command system extensible via CommandFactory.
- Dependency Inversion: Interfaces (Command, TerrainComponent) ensure loose coupling.

### Gold Standards
- Logging: Winston logs provide detailed debugging to console and mars-rover.log.
- Exception Handling: Try-catch for commands, 3-attempt retries for inputs.
- Input Validation: Regex and bounds checks ensure robust input handling.
- Performance: O(1) Set for obstacles, fixed-size array for command history.

### Enhancements
- Command History: Stores last 5 commands for status reports.
- Batch Execution: Supports direct (MMRMLM) and B mode inputs.
- User Experience: Space-themed prompts enhance engagement.
