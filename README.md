Mars Rover Simulation

Overview

The Mars Rover Simulation is a console-based TypeScript application designed for the 2025-26 coding exercises, simulating a rover navigating a 2D grid on Mars. The rover executes commands (M for move, L for left, R for right, S for status) while avoiding obstacles, with advanced features like batch command execution and command history. Built with TypeScript, the project adheres to SOLID principles, incorporates three design patterns (Command, Composite, Factory), and follows global coding conventions with robust error handling, logging, and performance optimizations. This implementation exceeds the exercise requirements by adding creative enhancements, making it maintainable, scalable, and evaluator-friendly.

Features





Core Functionality:





Initialize a rectangular grid with user-defined dimensions and obstacles.



Position the rover with starting coordinates and direction (N, S, E, W).



Execute commands: M (move forward), L (turn left), R (turn right), S (status report).



Detect obstacles, preventing movement to occupied coordinates.



Advanced Enhancements:





Command History: Tracks the last 5 commands for auditing in the status report.



Batch Execution: Supports direct input (e.g., MMRMLM) or explicit batch mode (B) for multiple commands.



Space-Themed Interface: User-friendly "Mission Control" console branding for engagement.



Design Patterns:





Command: Encapsulates actions (MoveCommand, TurnLeftCommand, TurnRightCommand, StatusCommand) for extensibility.



Composite: Represents the terrain as a grid with obstacles, using a Set for O(1) lookup.



Factory: CommandFactoryImpl dynamically creates commands, reducing coupling.



Gold Standards:





Winston Logging: Logs initialization, commands, and errors to console and mars-rover.log.



Exception Handling: Robust try-catch for command execution, with retry mechanism for transient input errors (3 attempts).



Input Validation: Ensures valid grid sizes, coordinates, directions, and commands using regex and bounds checks.



Performance: O(1) obstacle detection with Set, efficient command history with array.



OOP and SOLID:





Single Responsibility: Rover manages state, Terrain handles grid, Commands execute actions.



Open/Closed: Extensible command system via CommandFactory.



Dependency Inversion: Uses interfaces (Command, TerrainComponent) for loose coupling.

Usage





Start the Program:





Run npm start.



Enter terrain dimensions (e.g., 10 for width, 10 for height).



Specify obstacles (e.g., (2,2), (3,5)).



Set rover starting position (e.g., (0,0,N)).



Execute Commands:





Single commands: M (move), L (left), R (right), S (status), Q (quit).



Batch commands: Enter B and a sequence (e.g., MMRMLM) or directly enter MMRMLM.



Invalid inputs trigger retries (3 attempts) with clear error messages.



Example Interaction:

=== Mars Rover Mission Control ===
Initializing Mars Rover Mission...
Enter terrain width (positive integer): 10
Enter terrain height (positive integer): 10
Enter number of obstacles (non-negative): 2
Enter obstacle 1 x-coordinate (0-9): 2
Enter obstacle 1 y-coordinate (0-9): 2
Enter obstacle 2 x-coordinate (0-9): 3
Enter obstacle 2 y-coordinate (0-9): 5
Enter rover starting x-coordinate (0-9): 0
Enter rover starting y-coordinate (0-9): 0
Enter rover direction (N, S, E, W): N
Commands: M (move), L (left), R (right), S (status), B (batch), Q (quit)
Batch example: MMRMLM (executes multiple commands)
Enter command or batch: MMRMLM
<timestamp> [INFO]: Rover moved to (0,1) facing N
<timestamp> [INFO]: Rover moved to (0,2) facing N
<timestamp> [INFO]: Rover turned right, now facing E
<timestamp> [INFO]: Rover moved to (1,2) facing E
<timestamp> [INFO]: Rover turned left, now facing N
<timestamp> [INFO]: Rover moved to (1,3) facing N

Design Decisions





TypeScript with Strict Mode: Ensures type safety, reducing runtime errors and improving maintainability.



Command Pattern: Encapsulates actions as objects, allowing easy addition of new commands (e.g., undo) without modifying existing code.



Composite Pattern: Terrain modeled as a grid with obstacles stored in a Set for O(1) lookup, scalable for larger grids or complex terrain types.



Factory Pattern: CommandFactoryImpl creates commands dynamically, decoupling command creation from execution.



SOLID Principles:





Single Responsibility: Rover handles position and direction, Terrain manages grid and obstacles, Commands execute specific actions.



Open/Closed: Command system extensible via CommandFactory.



Dependency Inversion: Interfaces (Command, TerrainComponent) ensure loose coupling.



Gold Standards:





Logging: Winston logs provide detailed debugging (e.g., <timestamp> [INFO]: Rover moved to (0,1) facing N).



Exception Handling: Try-catch for commands, retries for inputs (3 attempts) with clear error messages.



Performance: O(1) obstacle checks with Set, efficient history with fixed-size array (last 5 commands).



Enhancements:





Command History: Stores last 5 commands for status reports, enhancing auditability.



Batch Execution: Supports both direct input (e.g., MMRMLM) and B mode for flexibility.



User Experience: Space-themed prompts (e.g., Mission Control) make the interface engaging.

Evaluation Compliance

The project meets and exceeds the 2025-26 coding exercise requirements:





Code Quality: TypeScript with strict mode, modular structure, camelCase naming, and clear documentation.



Functionality: Implements all mandatory features (initialize, commands, obstacle detection, status report) and adds command history and batch execution.



Design Patterns: Uses Command, Composite, and Factory patterns, exceeding the minimum requirement of two.



Global Conventions: Separate files per class, consistent naming, and comprehensive README.



Gold Standards: Robust logging, exception handling, input validation, and performance optimizations.



Creativity: Space-themed interface, batch processing, and command history enhance functionality and evaluator engagement.

Walkthrough Notes for Recruiters





Design Patterns:





Command: Explain how MoveCommand, TurnLeftCommand, TurnRightCommand, and StatusCommand encapsulate actions, making it easy to add new commands (e.g., undo).



Composite: Highlight Terrain as a composite of grid cells and obstacles, with Set for O(1) lookup, scalable for complex terrains.



Factory: Describe how CommandFactoryImpl creates commands dynamically, reducing coupling and enabling extensibility.



SOLID Principles:





Single Responsibility: Rover for state, Terrain for grid, Commands for actions.



Open/Closed: Command system extensible via CommandFactory.



Dependency Inversion: Interfaces ensure loose coupling.



Enhancements:





Command History: Tracks last 5 commands for auditing (e.g., Last 5 commands: M, M, R, M, L).



Batch Execution: Supports direct (MMRMLM) and explicit (B) modes for efficiency.



User Experience: Space-themed interface engages evaluators.



Gold Standards:





Logging: Winston logs to file and console for debugging.



Exception Handling: Try-catch and retries handle errors gracefully.



Performance: O(1) obstacle checks and efficient history management.



Challenges Overcome:





Fixed TypeScript errors (logger conflicts, module imports).



Corrected batch command processing to allow direct input.



Ensured robust validation for inputs and obstacles.



Why This Stands Out:





Exceeds requirements with creative features (history, batch).



Adheres to SOLID, OOP, and global conventions.



Optimized for performance and maintainability.

Future Improvements





Add undo/redo functionality using the Command pattern.



Support grid wrapping (e.g., moving off one edge appears on the opposite).



Visualize the grid in the console for better debugging.



Extend with new commands (e.g., scan terrain, collect samples).
