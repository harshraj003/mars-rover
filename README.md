# Mars Rover Simulation

## Abstract

A **TypeScript** console application simulating a Mars rover navigating a 2D grid, using **Command**, **Composite**, and **Factory** design patterns with features like batch command execution, command history, **Winston** logging, and an engaging space-themed interface.

---

## What is This Project?

The Mars Rover Simulation is an exciting console program built in **TypeScript** that lets you control a virtual Mars rover on a 2D grid, like you‚Äôre part of a real NASA mission. You set up a grid (think of it as a Mars map), add obstacles like rocks, and choose where the rover starts and which way it faces. Then, you give commands to move, turn, or check the rover‚Äôs status, and it smartly avoids obstacles. It‚Äôs designed to be easy to use, even for beginners, with a **‚ÄúMission Control‚Äù** theme that makes you feel like you‚Äôre exploring Mars. The program uses three design patterns to keep the code organized and shows off clean coding practices with error handling and logging.

## Why It Exists

This project was created to:

* Simulate a Mars rover navigating a grid, avoiding obstacles in a fun way.
* Demonstrate three design patterns (**Command, Composite, Factory**) in a clear, space-themed context.
* Provide a user-friendly experience with reliable code that‚Äôs easy to understand and extend.

---

## What It Does

* **Set Up a Mars Grid**: Create a grid (e.g., 10x10) and place obstacles.
* **Control the Rover**: Use commands like **M** (move forward), **L** (turn left), **R** (turn right), or **S** (check status).
* **Batch Commands**: Run multiple commands at once (e.g., `MMRMLM`) or use a batch mode.
* **Track History**: Shows the **last 5 commands** when you check status.
* **Avoid Obstacles**: Stops the rover from hitting rocks and shows an error.
* **Mission Control Theme**: Fun prompts make it feel like a real Mars mission.
* **Logging**: Saves actions to **mars-rover.log** and the console for tracking.

## How It‚Äôs Implemented

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Grid Setup** | Width and height (positive integers). | 10, 10 for a 10x10 grid. |
| | Number of obstacles (non-negative integer). | 2. |
| | Obstacle coordinates (x,y pairs, within grid bounds). | (2,2), (3,5). |
| **Rover Setup** | Starting position (x,y coordinates, within grid). | (0,0). |
| | Direction (string: N, S, E, W). | N for North. |
| **Commands** | Single commands: M, L, R, S, Q. | M (move), Q (quit). |
| | Batch commands: String of valid commands, or B for batch mode. | `MMRMLM`. |
| **Validation** | Grid: Positive integers, non-negative obstacle count, coordinates within bounds. | |
| | Rover: Coordinates within grid, valid direction (N, S, E, W). | |
| | Commands: Valid single or batch commands (regex: `[MLRSQ]+` for batch). | |
| **Outputs** | Console messages (e.g., ‚ÄúRover moved to (0,1) facing N‚Äù). | |
| | Status report: Position, direction, last 5 commands. | e.g., ‚ÄúRover is at (1,3) facing N. Last 5 commands: M, R, M, L, M‚Äù. |
| | Logs: Written to **mars-rover.log** with timestamps. | |

### Workflow

1.  **Program Start**: Loads `MarsRoverDemo.ts` and shows ‚ÄúMission Control‚Äù welcome.
2.  **Grid Setup**: Prompts for size and obstacles. Obstacle coordinates are stored in a **Set** for fast lookup. Inputs are validated with **retries (3 attempts)**.
3.  **Rover Setup**: Prompts for starting position and direction, with validation.
4.  **Command Loop**: Accepts single commands (**M, L, R, S, Q**) or batch sequences. Batch commands are processed sequentially, stopping if invalid or blocked by an obstacle. Invalid inputs trigger retries.
5.  **Logging**: Each action (setup, movement, errors) is logged to `mars-rover.log` and the console.
6.  **Loop**: Continues prompting for commands until **Q** is entered.

### Key Features in Code

* **TypeScript**: Ensures safe coding with strict type checks.
* **Design Patterns**:
    * **Command**: `Commands.ts` defines commands (`MoveCommand`, `TurnLeftCommand`, etc.) for flexible actions.
    * **Composite**: `Terrain.ts` uses a **Set** for $O(1)$ obstacle checks.
    * **Factory**: `CommandFactoryImpl` in `Commands.ts` creates commands dynamically.
* **Error Handling**: Uses `try-catch` and a `RetryOperation.ts` utility for up to **3 input retries**.
* **Logging**: `Logger.ts` uses **Winston** for console and file logging.
* **History**: `Rover.ts` tracks last 5 commands in a fixed-size array.

## How to Set Up and Run

### What You Need

* **Node.js**: Download version **20.x** from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
* **Git**: Install from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
* A terminal (e.g., Command Prompt on Windows) and an editor like VS Code.

### Step-by-Step Setup

1.  **Get the Code**:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/harshraj003/mars-rover.git](https://github.com/harshraj003/mars-rover.git)
    cd mars-rover
    ```

2.  **Install Tools**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    This sets up TypeScript, Winston, and other dependencies.

3.  **Start the Program**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    Follow prompts to set up the grid, obstacles, rover, and enter commands.

4.  **Optional: Build Code**:
    * To compile TypeScript to JavaScript:
        ```bash
        npm run build
        ```
    * To check for errors without saving files:
        ```bash
        npx tsc --noEmit
        ```

5.  **View Logs**:
    Check the log file:
    ```bash
    type mars-rover.log
    ```
    *Example:*
    `2025-10-02T16:36:45 [INFO]: Rover moved to (0,1) facing N`

## üöÄ How to Use It

### 1. Launch the Program

Run the command `npm start` to see the initial prompt:

```bash
=== Mars Rover Mission Control ===
Initializing Mars Rover Mission...

Set Up the Mission:
Enter grid size (e.g., 10 for width, 10 for height).
Add obstacles (e.g., (2,2), (3,5)).
Set rover‚Äôs starting point and direction (e.g., (0,0,N)).

Give Commands:
Single commands: M (move), L (left), R (right), S (status), Q (quit).
Batch commands: Type MMRMLM or B for batch mode.
2. Example Interaction
Step	User Input	Program Output/Context
Grid Setup	10, 10, 2	Sets 10x10 grid with 2 obstacles.
Obstacle 1	2, 2	Places obstacle at (2, 2).
Obstacle 2	3, 5	Places obstacle at (3, 5).
Rover Setup	0, 0, N	Starts rover at (0, 0) facing North.
Command	MMRMLM	Executes batch move/turn sequence.
Command Execution Log:

2025-10-02T16:36:45 [INFO]: Rover moved to (0,1) facing N
2025-10-02T16:36:45 [INFO]: Rover moved to (0,2) facing N

3. Handling Mistakes
If you enter an invalid command (e.g., X), the system will log a warning and prompt you to retry (up to 3 attempts):

Enter command or batch: X
2025-10-02T16:36:45 [WARN]: Invalid input. Use M, L, R, S, Q, or a sequence. Attempt 1/3
